            <h2>Abilities</h2>
                <h3>Fighter: Echo Knight, 4th Level</h3>
                    <h4>Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
                        <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. 
                            The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>

                    <h4>Second Wind</h4>
                        <p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. 
                            On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>
                        <p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>

                    <h4>Action Surge</h4>
                        <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
                            On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p>
                        <p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. 
                            Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>

                    <h4>Manifest Echo</h4>
                        <p>At 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. 
                            This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you're incapacitated.</p>
                        <p>Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions.
                            If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. 
                            It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. 
                            On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required).
                            If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.</p>
                        <li>As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.</li>
                        <li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo's space. 
                            You make this choice for each attack.</li>
                        <li>When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space.</li>

                    <h4>Unleash Incarnation</h4>
                        <p>At 3rd level, you can heighten your echo's fury. 
                            Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo's position.</p>
                        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once).
                            You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
