        <div class="intro">
            <p>The Marked Couriers is the unoffical name for the party of the 1st Main Campaign in Leairto. 
                    They are a band of adventuers who were hired to deliver a package on behalf on the Southern Isle Shipping Company.
                    Their carriage was attacked and the package stolen as a weird marking showed up on all of their left hands.
                    Now their mission is to retreive back their package, find out what the mark on their hand means, as well as many smaller personal tasks along the way.</p>

                <h3>A Botched Delivery</h3>
                    <p>Four adventuers: Etienne, Kindly, Pavoli, and Selena, were hired by the Southern Isle Shipping Company to transport a 10ft by 10ft container from the Port of Keyled to the Vauxledge Higlands. 
                        The head of transportation, Margin Bayleth, met them at the port and sent her assitant Greg to oversee their delivery.</p>

                    <p>Their first stop was a farm on the edge of the Town of Duncaster, where they were stopped by Farmer John begging for their help with dealing with cursed Carrots made by the Wizard in the woods.
                        After defeating the carrots, Greg had abandoned the party as they go back on the road, but almost instantly gets stopped by a mysterious Light-Blue Skinned Teifling who put half the party to sleep and took the myserious package while a brand appeared on all of their left hands.
                        As Pavoli awakes and they get back on the road with Selena still sleeping, they pass a family of farmers who tell them to return to the Farm.</p>

                    <p>When they return, it seems all the townsfolk have gathered in the farm house as Farmer John walks out and tells the party to go deal with the Wizard in the woods. 
                        Etienne, Kindly, and Pavoli venture into the woods while Selena is still asleep in the carriage. 
                        The three find an old wizard tower as a voice speaks to them and the tower shifts to make it hard for them to go to the upper floors.
                        They finally reach the study when they meet, Kolvair Favalur, or as Kindly, and the rest of the party calls them, Norm, who explains he is an intern for the wizard who owns the tower, Alarian, and that he is in Lithonia, the nearest city to the west.
                        Norm decides to leave with the party as they go back to their carriage.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the rest of the party was in the tower, Selena wakes up to Farmer John waking her up and inviting her inside the barn where she finds the entire town is involved in a cult called the Children of Protus and Greg on the altar bound by his hands.
                        The other memebers find Selena is gone and try to sneak into the barn, but all get caught by Father John as he says a prayer to Protus while lifting up an object, which sacrifces to whole cult and allows Father John to uses their corpses to fight the party.
                        John is defeated and as they go to leave with Greg, a giant beast made up of all the corpses of the cult starts chasing after their carriage, but is finally defeated for good when they jump the carriage over a casm
                    </p>
                <h3>A City of Seasons </h3>
                    <p>About a day into the journey, it seemed to instantly become Winter, and as the party woke up the next day, it seemingly turned to Spring overnight.
                        As they entered the Eladrin City of Lithonia, it seemed abandoned but they were instructed to meet with the Mayor in the Town Hall.
                        On the way, they stop at the only shop open in the whole city, the Wandering Hourglass, where they are offered a potion, but only Etienne drinks it, transporting him to a very large an expansive store.
                        When they arrived at Town Hall, they met with the Mayor, his legion of guards, and Alarian, as the Mayor explained how the city's "core" was stolen as it put the city in ruin, and asks the party to go find it in a nearby Goblin Cave, with the Mayor sending guards to lead them to it, with Norm staying behind with Alarian to explain why they are here. 
                        On their way out of town, they stopped back at the Wandering Hourglass, where the rest drank the offered potions and were telelported to an expansive Farmer's Market, where the Halfing owner, Thomas Bronzebrook, told them about how his shop works, and sold them a mystery potion.</p>
                        
                    <p>When they arrived at the cave, the guards turned against the party and threw them down into a giant hole in the cave.
                        In here, they met the heads of the four houses of Litonia, each representing a season, with Yomei Spring doing most of the talking, telling the party about the city being overthrown and the amulets of the four seasons being the "core" thr man was talking about.
                        Being given the amulets, the pary adventure through the cave using the amulet's powers, before arriving back the enterance, where they see the guards were dressed up goblins the whole time.
                        The goblins explain that they were just hired by "The Mayor" and don't know his true plan. 
                        As they rush back to the city, the seasons begin changing rapidly, and when infront of the Town Hall, the mayor chnages form to be an older red Teifling by the name of Dagan. 
                        The party fight off him and his army of gun weilding goblins, with Dagan escaping, and meet back up with Norm and Alarain who were stuck in Town Hall, fighting them off as well.</p>

                    <p>The party stays in the city as a week passes and the party is named Champions of Lithonia. 
                        Pavoli meets with one of his old students, William, from when he was a Professor at the Unviersity (Unamed) and shows him how he was continuing his department's research and to meet him and his team at Snake's Canyon.
                        Etienne talks with Lady Death and it is revealed his cat, Her Majesty, was orginally Dagan's cat and that him and Lady Death have a history together.
                        Selena goes out as Dagan comes up to her and tells her to return home and that her brother has now run away from home too.
                        Kindly created a Kid's soccer league and talks with Norm who says that Alaraian's brother that lives in the Black Hallow Forest could help identify the marking on their hands.
                        Another Week passes, Yomei presents gifts created by the Four houses to the adventuers as they decide to head towards the Black Hallow Forest. </p>
